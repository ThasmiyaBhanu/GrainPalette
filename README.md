# GrainPalette - A-Deep-Learning-Odyssey-In-Rice-Type-Classification-Through-Transfer-Learning
The Rice Type Identification AI model provides a solution for farmers and agriculture enthusiasts to identify various types of rice grains quickly and accurately.
By uploading an image of a rice grain and clicking the submit button, users receive predictions for the probable type of rice, enabling informed decisions on cultivation practices such as water and fertilizer requirements. Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and employing transfer learning with MobileNetv4, this model offers reliable classification of up to five different types of rice, catering to the needs of farmers, agriculture scientists, home growers, and gardeners.
